MDG: Metaphor Detection and Generation with Masked Metaphor Modeling - Data and Source Code

This study tackles literal to metaphorical sentence generation, presenting a framework that can potentially lead to the production of an infinite number of new metaphors.  
To achieve this goal, we propose a complete workflow that tackles metaphorical sentence classification and metaphor reconstruction.
Unlike similar research studies regarding metaphor generation, our approach does not require any custom model, hence with this work we introduce a complete literal to metaphorical open-source framework, that only exploits fine-tuned Transformers models and architectures.
The obtained results show that 24\%, 31\% and 56\% of the (originally literal) sentences are turned to metaphorical by changing a single noun, adjective or verb of the sentence, respectively.
Human evaluation, conducted by an English teacher and graduate of English literature, shows that our constructed metaphors are considered more fluent, creative and metaphorical than figurative statements created by a real person.
Furthermore, by using our artificial data to increase the training size of a metaphorical sentence classification dataset, we register an improvement of 3\% over the baseline.
