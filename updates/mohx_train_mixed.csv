" Music is filled with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments",1
" The word originated from Greek μουσική (mousike; ""(art) of the Muses"")",1
"In its most general form, the activities portraying music as an art form or cultural activity include the creation of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music",1
" Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers conceived music in two parts: melodies, as tones ordered horizontally, and harmonies as tones ordered vertically",1
" However, 20th-century composer John Cage theorized that any sound can be music, saying, for example, ""There is no noise, only sound",1
" There are many types of music, namely popular music, traditional music, art music, music written for religious ceremonies, and work songs such as chanteys",1
g,1
", country music) and genres can be further divided into subgenres (e",1
g,1
" Music may be played or sung and enjoyed live at a rock concert or orchestra performance, heard live as part of a dramatic work (a music theater show or opera), or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio, MP3 player, CD player, smartphone or as film score or TV show",1
g,1
", graduation and marriage), social activities (e",1
g,1
", dancing) and cultural activities shifting from amateur karaoke singing to playing in an amateur funk band or singing in a community choir",1
" People may embrace music as a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a youth orchestra, or work as a professional musician or singer",1
" The music industry includes the individuals who craft new songs and musical pieces (such as songwriters and composers), individuals who perform music (which include orchestra, jazz band and rock band musicians, singers and conductors), individuals who record music (music producers and sound 
engineers), individuals who organize concert tours, and individuals who sell recordings, sheet music, and scores to customers",1
"\nMusic may also refer to:', 'Classical music is art music produced or absorbed in the traditions of Western culture, generally considered to have begun in Europe after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the late 5th century CE and continuing to present day",1
" The major periods involved the medieval (500–1400), Renaissance (1400–1600), Baroque (1600–1750), Classical (1750–1820), Romantic (1800–1910), Modernist (1890–1975) and Postmodern era/Contemporary (1950–present) eras",1
" The earliest reference to ""classical music"" carried by the Oxford English Dictionary is from about 1829",1
Western staff notation is employed by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches and durations for a piece of music,1
It reflects both sacred (religious) and secular music,1
", 'Electronic music is music that blends electronic musical instruments, digital instruments, or circuitry-based music technology in its creation",1
It incorporates both music made using electronic and electromechanical means (electroacoustic music),1
" Pure electronic instruments run entirely on circuitry-based sound generation, for instance using devices such as an electronic oscillator, theremin, or synthesizer",1
" Electromechanical instruments can carry mechanical parts such as strings, hammers, and electric elements including magnetic pickups, power amplifiers and loudspeakers",1
" Such electromechanical devices comprise the telharmonium, Hammond organ, electric piano and the electric guitar",1
The first electronic musical devices were created at the end of the 19th century,1
" During the 1920s and 1930s, a number of electronic instruments were invented and the first compositions featuring them were written",1
" By the 1940s, magnetic audio tape encouraged musicians to tape sounds and then modify them by changing the tape speed or direction, leading to the development of electroacoustic tape music in the 1940s, in Egypt and France",1
" Musique concrète, revived in Paris in 1948, was based on editing together recorded fragments of natural and industrial sounds",1
Music drawn solely from electronic generators was first produced in Germany in 1953,1
Electronic music was also generated in Japan and the United States beginning in the 1950s and Algorithmic composition with computers was first demonstrated in the same decade,1
" In the early 1970s, Moog synthesizers and Japanese drum machines helped shape synthesized electronic music",1
" In the early 1980s mass produced digital synthesizers, such as the Yamaha DX7, grew popular and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was developed",1
", 'A music video is a short film or video, of variable length, that depicts a song or album with imagery that is produced for promotional or artistic purposes",1
Tie-ins and merchandising can be echanged for toys or for food or other products,1
"\nAlthough the origins of the music video date back to musical short films that first emerged in the 1920s, they again came into prominence in the 1980s when the channel MTV (originally ""Music Television"") based its format around the medium",1
" Prior to the 1980s, these kinds of videos were characterized by various terms including ""illustrated song,"" ""filmed insert,""  ""promotional (promo) film,"" ""promotional clip,"" ""promotional video,"" ""song video,"" ""song clip,"" or ""film clip",1
"""\nMusic videos reflect a wide range of styles and contemporary video-making techniques, including animation, live-action, documentary, and non-narrative approaches such as abstract film",1
" Some music videos fuse different styles with music, such as animation and live-action",1
"  Other music videos may not convey any concept, being only a filmed version of the song\'s live concert performance",1
Some types of folk music may be found world music,1
It has been restored with commercial and classical styles,1
" This type of folk music also blends fusion genres such as folk rock, folk metal, and others",1
" While contemporary folk music reflects a genre generally distinct from traditional folk music, in U",1
S,1
" English it shares the same name, and it often attracts the same performers and venues as traditional folk music",1
"Music can be broken into genres in varying ways, such as popular music and art music, or religious music and secular music",1
"Dance is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments",1
" The term derives from Greek μουσική (mousike; ""(art) of the Muses"")",1
